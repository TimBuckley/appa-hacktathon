Happy Camper
============

A mobile app for finding out about coding bootcamp graduates and the careers they get after graduation. Built with a React native front-end and a Rails 4 API for the inaugural AppAcademy Alumni Hackathon.

Why We Made It
--------------

The coding bootcamp model seems almost too good to be true for prospective students, and it can be hard to determine which bootcamp will best help you get the career you want. With this app, you can see where graduates are getting hired and how long it takes them to get a job after their course.

Set Up
------

TBD

Todos
-----

* Currently only shows app academy graduates. We would like to get graduates from other prominent bootcamps for the sake of comparison.
* Better error handling for bad Linkedin URLs.
* Cool, shiny graphs showing aggregate data on bootcamp grads and company info.
